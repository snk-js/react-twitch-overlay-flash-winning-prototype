1. From the last change I have tried to decouple into a even more encapsulation of the effects, because I feel the need to isolate them so that I can create a well managed sequence of them, dynamically with code. The following prompt let to these changes:
   1. ```"create a minimum descent style for the buttons, render them dynamically like an array of effects and fix reseting the animations, because after each one been called, only the confetti is reactivated from 0 on pressing each of the buttons"```
