This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Emphasize
I choose to emphasize the animation composition and developer experience in the code design, this is a decision made under the argument how easy an animation can be tunned and maintanable.

## **Tools**
- GSAP: v3.13;
- NextJS & React: Latest;
- Tailwind: v4;
- Typescript: V5;

## **One thing youâ€™d improve with more time**
- I would complete integration with Twitch and OBS if possible

## **Time spend**
- More or less 5 hours with AI help and Tunning with my own adjustments

## **AI fixes**
- The AI fixes are documented in commits itself when the commit doesn't have change within prompts directory
